# Final project on Learning

## Modes of Thinking

### Focused and Diffuse Modes
- Our two (very different) modes of thinking
- At any moment, we are either operating in one mode or in the other
- Focused mode
	- Used when learning something new or solving a problem we are already familiar with
	- Employs existing, tight neural connections
	- Achieved through intentional concentration
- Diffuse mode
	- Allows us to look at things from a different, big picture perspective
	- Forms new neural connections along new pathways
	- Activated only when we are not focusing on the problem

### Leveraging the Focused and Diffuse Modes
- Going back and forth between modes is necessary when we are learning something new
	- This process takes time, so this is why learning must achieved by everyday practice - and not in a single cramming session
- Examples of creators and artists who were famous for leveraging this transition are Thomas Edison and Salvador Dali
	- Their techniques were similar: first relax, let the mind wander, start to fall asleep and then soon wake up, in order to consciously access ideas from the diffuse mode


### Procrastination
- What is it?
	- Procrastination means to keep delaying something that must be done, often because it is unpleasant or boring
	- Although everyone has issues with procrastination to some extent, some people struggle with it more than others
- What causes it?
	- When we are about to do something that we would rather not do, we activate areas of our brain associated with pain
	- Our brain then tries to avoid that negative feeling by directing our focus to something else more pleasant
- Why is it bad?
	- Procrastination takes away time that is precious and should be used to do or learn something more important
	- It also has similarities with drug addiction, in the way it tricks your brain to do something more pleasant 
	- Studies also show that the uncomfortable feeling that triggers procrastination usually goes away after we start working on the task
- How can we avoid it?
	- The Pomodoro Technique
		- When you are about to start a difficult task, one that needs attention, get rid of all distractions, set a timer to 25 minutes, and start working with focus for that time. 
		- After you finish your 25-minute stretch, reward yourself with something you like

### The Importance of Practice
- Abstract concepts, such as those in math and science, are harder to learn because they don't correspond to concrete things in our daily lives
- To solidify those concepts in our memory, we need practice -- by reasoning about and applying them, we strengthen the neural connections and make those concepts more concrete

## Short-term and Long-term Memory
- These are the two major memory systems we have
- Short-term or Working memory
	- Stores what your are currently and consciously processing
	- Is centered in the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for the executive functions of the brain
	- Connects to other parts of the brain, so it can access long-term memories
	- Can store only about four chunks of information at the same time
	- Works like a *blackboard*, but not a very good one: we have to repeat or use other techniques to make information stick to it

- Long-term memory
	- Stores all our memories, including fundamental concepts and techniques involved in what we are learning
	- Is distributed over a big area of the brain
	- Can store billions of items
	- Works like a *warehouse*, but to increase the chances that we are able to access an item later, we need to revisit it a few times

Analogies are a great tool for learning

Procrastination

Pomodoro technique - a way to avoid procrastination

Practice, test yourself - retrieval as a simple tool for improving memory
- recall is a mini-test

Deliberate practice
- test yourself on the difficult topics, not the easy ones

Spaced repetition
- good match for the sleep effect on learning

Interleaving - intersperse your learning from different topics, so that you can maximize your results, and make new connections.

Einstellung

Over-learning - going beyond what is needed to dominate a topic well enough for your objectives - may lead to illusions of competence and Einstellung

Illusions of competence

The importance of sleep

Long-term memory vs short-term memory

Chunking as a form of compacting information to fit working memory

Procrastination - why it is so bad
- You need time to learn, procrastination takes it away from you

The four parts of a habit - and how to tackle each of them to avoid procrastination
- Cue
- Routine
- Reward
- Belief

Focus on process instead of product
