### by Marden Neubert

**A summary of learnings from the Learning How to Learn course**

---

# Modes of Thinking
- **Focused** and **Diffuse**: our two (very different) modes of thinking
- At any moment, we are operating in either one mode or the other

---

# Focused Mode
- Used when learning something new or solving a problem we are already familiar with
- Employs existing, tight neural connections
- Achieved through intentional concentration

---

# Diffuse Mode
- Allows us to look at things from a big picture perspective
- Forms new neural connections along new pathways
- Activated only when we are not focusing on the problem

---

# Leveraging the Thinking Modes
- Going back and forth between modes is necessary when we are learning something new
	- This process takes time, so this is why learning must achieved by everyday practice - and not in a single cramming session
- Examples of creators and artists who were famous for leveraging this transition are Thomas Edison and Salvador Dali
	- Their techniques were similar: first relax, let the mind wander, start to fall asleep and then soon wake up, in order to consciously access ideas from the diffuse mode

---

# Procrastination
- What is it?
	- Procrastination means to keep delaying something that must be done, often because it is unpleasant or boring
	- Although everyone has issues with procrastination to some extent, some people struggle with it more than others

---

# Procrastination
- What causes it?
	- When we are about to do something that we would rather not do, we activate areas of our brain associated with pain
	- Our brain then tries to avoid that negative feeling by directing our focus to something else more pleasant

---

# Procrastination
- Why is it bad?
	- Procrastination takes away time that is precious and should be used to do or learn something - learning is a bit by bit activity, so it demands time
	- It has similarities with drug addiction, in the way it tricks your brain to do something more pleasant 
	- Studies also show that the uncomfortable feeling that triggers procrastination usually goes away after we start working on the task

---

# How We Can Avoid Procrastination
- First of all: it takes *a lot* of willpower - and willpower is a limited resource, so better use it only when absolutely necessary

---

# How We Can Avoid Procrastination
- Leverage the **power of habit**
- Habits are an energy saver; they allow us to start and follow an activity without wasting a lot of energy

---

# How We Can Avoid Procrastination
- Habits are composed by four parts and each of these can be tweaked to help avoid procrastination
	1. Cue: the trigger that launch us into habit mode
	2. Routine: the response your brain goes into after the cue
	3. Reward: the result we expect after the completion of the routine
	4. Belief: gives power to the habit, for instance the belief that you can put off your studies until late

---

# How We Can Avoid Procrastination
- Focus on **Process instead of Product**
	- **Process** is the flow of activities related to some task
	- **Product** is the final result of the task 
	- Focusing more on Product means to not worry about the final outcome and focus on starting the routine, get into the flow and relax

---

# How We Can Avoid Procrastination
- Use the Pomodoro Technique:
	- When you are about to start a difficult task, one that needs attention, get rid of all distractions, set a timer to 25 minutes, and start working with focus for that time. 
	- After you finish your 25-minute stretch, reward yourself with something you like

---

# The Importance of Practice
- Abstract concepts, such as those in math and science, are harder to learn because they don't correspond to concrete things in our daily lives
- To solidify those concepts in our memory, we need practice
	- By reasoning about and applying new concepts, we strengthen the neural connections and make those concepts more concrete

---

# Memory Systems
- Short-term and Long-term memory are the two major memory systems we have

---

# Short-term or Working Memory
- Stores what your are currently and consciously processing
- Is centered in the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for the executive functions of the brain
- Connects to other parts of the brain, so it can access long-term memories
- Can store only about four chunks of information at the same time
- Works like a **blackboard**, but not a very good one: we have to repeat or use other techniques to make information stick to it

---

# Long-term Memory
- Stores all our memories, including fundamental concepts and techniques involved in what we are learning
- Is distributed over a big area of the brain
- Can store billions of items
- Works like a **warehouse**, but to increase the chances that we are able to access an item later, we need to revisit it a few times

---

# Sleep and Learning
- Sleep allows our brains to get rid of toxins they produce while we are awake
- During sleep, our brains consolidate our learning, getting rid of irrelevant ideas and reinforcing the important ones
	- They rehearse the tougher parts of what we are learning and reinforce those neural patterns
	- Sleep also helps form new neural connections by going into diffuse mode
		- We first to enter focused mode to put new information in our memory

---

# What is Chunking
- Chunking is the process of grouping information through meaning or use
	- The chunk formed is easier to remember than each bit of information and can fit into the big picture of what we are learning
	- Only when we understand the **context** we are able to fit the chunk with other topics
	- Chunks are **packed knowledge** and are used when we get dressed, do math, speak a language, dance, or practice a sport

---

# How Chunks Are Formed
- When we learn, first we form mini-chunks, then later we connect them to form larger chunks 
- Work-through examples/tutorials help when we are starting to learn a new topic 
- Steps for forming a chunk
	1. Focus your undivided attention
	2. Understand the basic idea
	3. Gain context - learn *when* to use the chunk

---

# How Chunks Are Formed
- The more chunks we have in our minds, the more skilled and creative we get - and we can even learn faster
	- **Transfer** is the fact that chunks we have formed also help us learn new material, even in unrelated fields	
	- Related to that is the fact that **analogies** are a great tool for learning

---

# The Importance of Testing
- Testing ourselves is an important part of learning
	- Formal or informal tests help forming chunks because the process of retrieving the information helps solidify the learning

---

# The Importance of Testing
- **Recall** is a simple and effective technique when learning a new content (much better than rereading)
	- It is like a mini-test: after reading a material, stop and try to recall it, ask yourself what is there, quiz yourself on some of the topics

---

# The Importance of Testing
- **Illusion of competence** is the false impression that we know a material
	- We can avoid it by testing ourselves, using recall and other types of tests - mistakes that we may make in those tests allow us to catch illusions of competence
	- Keeping highlighting to a minimum (one sentence per paragraph) also helps avoiding this illusion
	- Another technique is to recall the material in a different place, not where we have studied it - the spatial cues we get from being in another place help solidify the learning

---

# Concepts and Techniques in Learning
- **Overlearning** is to keep studying and practicing what we already learned, going beyond what is needed to dominate a topic
	- This helps in gaining automaticity, which can be applicable in some situations, but also may lead to illusions of competence and Einstellung (*see below*)

---

# Concepts and Techniques in Learning
- **Deliberate practice** is to focus (and test ourselves) on more and more difficult material (instead of the ones we have already mastered) and is more effective than overlearning
- **Spaced repetition** is a technique for spacing learning sessions and practices over days and is good match for the sleep effect on learning

---

# Concepts and Techniques in Learning
- **Einstellung** is the fact that a initial thought or concept we have may prevent a better idea from being found
- **Interleaving** is to intersperse our learning from different topics, so that you can maximize our results, and make new neural connections.
